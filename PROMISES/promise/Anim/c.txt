The Promise constructor takes a function (an executor)
 that will be executed immediately and passes in two 
 functions: resolve, which must be called when the Promise 
 is resolved (passing a result), 
 and reject when it is rejected (passing an error).
The executor is to be executed by the constructor,
 during the process of constructing the new Promise object.
resolveFunction is called on promise fulfilled.
rejectFunction is called on promise rejection.
